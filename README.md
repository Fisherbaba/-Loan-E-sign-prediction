# -Loan-E-sign-prediction
### **Project Conclusion (Summary)**  

Our model, with an accuracy of ~64%, helps predict whether a user will complete the e-signing step of the loan application. This prediction can be leveraged to enhance the onboarding process by targeting users less likely to finish the e-sign phase with customized onboarding. 

By providing tailored onboarding experiences, we aim to reduce user drop-off and guide more users toward completing the loan application. If we succeed in converting at least 40% of these predicted drop-offs, it will significantly boost the number of completed applications, leading to increased profits. Since lending companies generate revenue with every loan issued, improving conversion rates through intentional onboarding design has the potential to deliver substantial financial gains.
