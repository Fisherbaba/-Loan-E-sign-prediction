### **Project Overview: Predicting Loan Applicant Quality**  

Lending companies assess the financial history of applicants to determine whether they are suitable for a loan. If deemed eligible, the terms of the loan are established. Applicants can reach these companies directly through their websites or apps, often supported by advertisement campaigns. Alternatively, lending companies partner with peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces, such as **Upstart**, **LendingTree**, and **LendingClub**, to acquire leads. 

This project focuses on evaluating the **quality of leads** obtained from these marketplaces. Specifically, we aim to predict which applicants are more likely to complete a critical part of the loan application process—such as the **e-signing phase**—and are thus considered 'quality' applicants. 
### **Business Problem**

In this case study, we collaborate with a **fintech company** specializing in offering **low APR loans** based on applicants' financial behavior. The company has partnered with a **peer-to-peer (P2P) lending marketplace** to acquire real-time leads. While the current **conversion rates** from these leads are satisfactory, the company aims to improve further. 

The challenge is to **predict whether a lead will complete the electronic signature (e-sign) phase** of the loan application. This step is critical, as it indicates the applicant’s intent to finalize the loan process.  

The goal of the project is to build a **predictive model** to:
1. **Identify lower-quality applicants** (i.e., those who are less likely to reach the e-sign phase).  
2. **Experiment with customized onboarding experiences** for these applicants by showing them different screens, with the goal of improving engagement and conversion rates.

By using this model, the company hopes to **minimize drop-offs**, leading to more completed applications and, ultimately, increased profits.
#### **Project Details**  
- **Market:** Loan applicants referred by P2P marketplaces.  
- **Product:** Loans provided by the lending company.  
- **Goal:** Build a **predictive model** to identify 'quality' applicants—those who reach essential steps in the loan process.  

By leveraging this model, companies can better tailor their onboarding processes to reduce drop-offs and increase loan completion rates, ultimately leading to higher profits.
### **Project Conclusion (Summary)**  

Our model, with an accuracy of ~64%, helps predict whether a user will complete the e-signing step of the loan application. This prediction can be leveraged to enhance the onboarding process by targeting users less likely to finish the e-sign phase with customized onboarding. 

By providing tailored onboarding experiences, we aim to reduce user drop-off and guide more users toward completing the loan application. If we succeed in converting at least 40% of these predicted drop-offs, it will significantly boost the number of completed applications, leading to increased profits. Since lending companies generate revenue with every loan issued, improving conversion rates through intentional onboarding design has the potential to deliver substantial financial gains.
